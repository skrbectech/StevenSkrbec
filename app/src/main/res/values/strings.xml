I always wanted to become an android developer, always tinkered at developing Android applications and Reusing old code for new applications.<br><br>
I would always delete the whole project and start over from the beginning to more understand how it works.<br><br>
All the different ways of developing an Android Application at first can be a little a little overwhelming, all the “strings, XML, imports, if statements”, even compiling, but after some time I would understand the workings and why this does what it does.<br><br>
Developing an android application should have good planning, yes you can click on that "Android Studio" icon and start coding away, but the more the application comes alive, the more you wish you planned it all out in the beginning.

        a fun (a little goofy at times), friendly,  and tech-savvy nerd,  I develop computer programs and write code in my spare time.  I firmly believe brilliance equals creativity and nerdy-ness.<br><br>
Developing mobile applications and software programs can make a global impact, picturing new ways technology can affect lives around the world; and I want to be apart of that impact. <br><br>
I like to immerse myself in the coding language and sharing with others what I have taught myself or what other have taught me.  I do feel fulfilled when solving problems using the knowledge I have learned over time.<br><br>

I am exceptionally focused when developing Android applications, hours can feel like just a few minutes.  I am highly detailed-oriented, with outstanding work ethics; determined to solve problems no matter what it is, and very driven to constantly learn to advance myself and my knowledge.<br><br>

I believe myself to be a passionate learner and push myself to learn new things every day.<br><br>

GIRL was my very first android application I developed, with that being said it was rated a 4.5 out of a 5 star.
GIRL got half a million downloads within a 6 month time.  Everyone from Android phone to tablet was able to download this application.
The application had a TAG it button, when your favorite song is playing you would have the ability to tag it to your Facebook page with a link so others can download GIRL application was well.

Caribou Coffee was a unique application, when I was developing it.
It never got published due to Caribou Coffee developing its own application internally.
It had a fadin, fadout splash screen while downloading the new content.
It allowed Facebook postings, store locations, and eventually would have had the ability to pay with gift card built into the app and a points system.

This Android Application allowed you to see current events going on at KSU.  You also had the ability to watch LIVE the broadcasters broadcasting.  This application didn’t get very many downloads because it was designed for KSU students only.

WhenICrave for android had it own unique touch as well.  It had the ability to find out where food is in your area that you are craving.  Most of the functions were json calls to the website to get the search results.  We also built and ad space so companies would be able to sign up and pay for ad space on the website and application allowing WhenICrave to be FREE for download but the company I built WhenICrave for decided to go private with it.

Sometimes even artist needs an Android application.  This Android application allowed users to set the artists art as wallpaper.  It allowed you to pick between six different art designs.  The concept of the application was to have all the artists’ art in a single android application.

        This application was a very busy application, its ability to get employee phones numbers for the company so you no longer need to put them into your personal contacts.  It also had the ability to set the alarm clock and forget it, the alarm would only go off on the time you wanted it go for example; if you worked at 9a.m. on Monday and 11am on Tuesday, also 6pm on Thursday you could set Shift Gears 365 for Android to have the alarm go off 2 hours before each shift.
Shift Gears 365 also had the ability to swap shifts with others, give away a shift, and even request vacation time.  Schedules could be viewed by Month, Day, and Week. You also had the ability to see who you are working with; each request for Shift Gears 365 was a API call using json, PHP, Mysql, SQlite.  Auto downloading schedules was a snap, just pick “auto download” and the time you wanted to download or sync the schedule, or manual download the schedule for some people that don’t have unlimited data.
